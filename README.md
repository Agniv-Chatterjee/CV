I started learning web development in November 2021 and this is the first project I tried after completing the HTML module. 
Web development especially Full stack development is very interesting as it teaches us on how we can build a website from scratch using front end designing elements like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, etc and also link then with back end databases. 
The course I bought from udemy is: The Complete Web Development Bootcamp By Dr Angela Yu. The course is very easy to understand and highly recommended for beginners.
